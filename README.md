# yonocosm
Non-branching Yono-like art construct where each new "level" splits and previous one.

A work-in-progress viewer for an art project in which each new piece acts as a bridge between the upper, lower, left, and right halves of the piece that came before it -- creating a kind of automatic rippling tessellation.
